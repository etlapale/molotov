Molotov Installation Guide
==========================

Molotov is a set of Python web applications allowing quickly setup of project
websites. Each web application is designed as a module called a *coktail*.

Requirements
------------

To install Molotov, the following software packages must be installed:

 * Python, version >= 2.4.
 * CherryPy, version >= 2.2.
 * The SQLObject objet-relational mapper (and a backend, eg sqlite).
 * Buffet as template abstraction layer.
 * The Kid template system.
 * Docutils, to parse the reStructuredText format.

Optional requirements:

 * Subversion, to get SVN repository support.
 * Bazaar-ng, to get Bazaar repository support.

Installing Molotov
------------------

The current installation way is to copy the whole Molotov tree structure
in your web installation directory.

Configuration
-------------

To configure the Molotov application, edit the molotov.conf file according
to your needs.

Running the standalone server
-----------------------------

As CherryPy provides a standalone web server, you can simply run it
and view the result without using a classical HTTP server such
as Apache or LightTPD. To start the server, simply run the following command::

    $ ./start-molotov yourconfigfile.conf

Then, fire up a browser and go to the location ``http://localhost:8080/``.

Using Molotov
-------------

Once your Molotov website is up and running you should be able to make changes
to the content via its web interface (eg. modify wiki pages). The wiki cocktail
also provides further documentation (also accessible in the `help/` directory
in reStructuredText format).

Enjoy!
